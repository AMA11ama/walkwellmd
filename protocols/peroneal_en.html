<h1>Peroneal Tendon Repair – Rehabilitation Protocol</h1>
<p class="muted">By WalkWellMD (clinic instruction sheet)</p>

<h2>Follow-up Visits</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Day 3: wound check</li>
  <li>Day 9: wound check</li>
  <li>Day 15: suture removal</li>
  <li>Then every 2 weeks until cast/boot removal</li>
</ul>

<h2>Early Care (Weeks 0–2)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Immobilization:</strong> Your foot is in a splint or cast. Do not remove it. Do not get it wet. No water should touch the surgical site until your surgeon confirms the wound is fully healed and gives permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Keep your foot elevated above heart level as much as possible to reduce swelling.</li>
  <li><strong>Weight-bearing:</strong> Do not put any weight on the operated foot. Always use crutches or a walker.</li>
  <li><strong>Medication:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Antibiotics for 7 days – complete the full course.</li>
      <li>Pain management: you have been prescribed a stronger pain medication (narcotic) and a standard pain reliever (non-narcotic).
        <ul>
          <li>First 72 hours: take both medications regularly regardless of pain (starting today).</li>
          <li>Days 4–6: take the non-narcotic medication regularly regardless of pain.</li>
          <li>From day 7 onward: take pain medication only if needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Blood clot prevention:</strong> Take aspirin once daily for 14 days unless your doctor instructs otherwise.</li>
  <li><strong>Precautions:</strong> No driving, no sports, no heavy lifting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Weeks 2–6</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Transition to an Air Cast / CAM boot.</li>
  <li>You may place light weight only for balance with crutches (not full weight).</li>
  <li>Boot must remain on at all times except when bathing or dressing the wound.</li>
  <li>Begin gentle toe motion and ankle movement within the boot as instructed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Weeks 6–8</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Continue in boot. You may gradually put more weight using crutches for support.</li>
  <li>Begin physiotherapy: ankle range of motion, swelling control (ice, elevation, gentle massage).</li>
  <li>Still no running, jumping, or twisting.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Weeks 8–12</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discontinue boot once cleared by your surgeon.</li>
  <li>Full weight-bearing in regular supportive shoes.</li>
  <li>Physiotherapy focus: strengthening, balance training, gait correction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Months 3–6</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Progress to treadmill walking and light jogging if pain-free.</li>
  <li>Avoid sports that require sudden side-to-side movements until cleared.</li>
  <li>Return to desk work and most daily activities. Heavy work may need clearance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Months 6+</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gradual return to full sports and unrestricted activity once strength and balance are restored and your surgeon approves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Red Flags – Call Us Immediately</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fever &gt; 38°C</li>
  <li>Worsening pain or swelling not relieved by rest/medication</li>
  <li>Calf pain, swelling, or sudden shortness of breath</li>
  <li>Wound redness, pus, or foul odor</li>
  <li>Numbness or inability to move toes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Swelling &amp; Elevation</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Swelling is normal after surgery and may last for several months.</li>
  <li>Always keep your foot elevated above heart level when resting.</li>
  <li>Use ice packs for 15–20 minutes at a time, several times daily, especially after activity.</li>
  <li>Swelling often increases at the end of the day — rest and elevate to help reduce it.</li>
</ul>
